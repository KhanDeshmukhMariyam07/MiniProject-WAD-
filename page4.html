        <p>
            Vaadhoo (Dhivehi: ވާދޫ) is one of the inhabited islands of Raa Atoll, Maldives. Famous for the
            bioluminescence plankton (Redhan), the spectacular "Sea of Stars" can be experienced in this island yearly.
            With clean roads and white sandy beaches, Vaadhoo is one of the most beautiful inhabited islands in the
            Maldives and its local tourism industry is expected to boom in the upcoming years.

            Vaadhoo island is famous for the 'sea of stars.' This marine bioluminescence is generated by phytoplankton
            known as dinoflagellates. Woodland Hastings of Harvard University has for the first time identified a
            special channel in the dinoflagellate cell membrane that responds to electrical signals—offering a potential
            mechanism for how the algae create their unique illumination.
