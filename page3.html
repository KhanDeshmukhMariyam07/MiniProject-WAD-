        <p>
            Salar de Uyuni, located in southwest Bolivia, is the world's largest salt flat, covering over 10,000 square kilometers (about 3,900 square miles) at an elevation of around 3,656 meters (11,995 feet) above sea level. This natural wonder was formed as a result of prehistoric lakes that evaporated, leaving behind a vast expanse of salt crust. During the rainy season (typically from December to April), a thin layer of water transforms the salt flat into a stunning reflective surface, creating surreal mirror-like illusions. Visitors flock to Salar de Uyuni to witness this otherworldly spectacle, which offers unparalleled opportunities for photography and exploration.
