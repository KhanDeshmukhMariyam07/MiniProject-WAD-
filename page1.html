        <h2>About the Amazon Rainforest</h2>
        <p>The Amazon rainforest,[a] also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in
            the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2
            (2,700,000 sq mi),[2] of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region
            includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories.

            The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor
            amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as
            the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian
            Park" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of Earth's remaining
            rainforests,[3] and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world,
            with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species.[4]

            More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9
            different national political systems and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous
            peoples make up 9% of the total population, and 60 of the groups remain largely isolated.[5]

            Large scale deforestation is occurring in the forest, creating different harmful effects. Economic losses
            due to deforestation in Brazil could be approximately 7 times higher in comparison to the cost of all
            commodities produced through deforestation. In 2023, the World Bank published a report proposing a
            non-deforestation based economic program in the region.[6][7]<img src="amazon3.jpg" alt="Amazon"
